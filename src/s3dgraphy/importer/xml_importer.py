"""XML → graph, through the SAME rich mapping the table importers read.

## Why this exists

The WP3 table (Vassallo) arrives as XML, and until now every source this library
could map was a table: a row, columns, one `table_settings`. An XML has neither —
it has a tree, and a "column" is a PATH into it. So the schema grew a
`source_path` per field and a `record_path` per source (see
`s3dgraphy.mappings.authoring`), and this importer is the consumer of exactly
that.

## What it does NOT do

It does not re-implement the mapping. `BaseImporter` already knows how to turn a
row dict into nodes, properties and the paradata chain from `column_mappings`; a
second implementation would be a second set of rules to keep in step. So this
class does one thing: **it turns a tree into rows.** Each element at
`record_path` becomes a `{source_path: value}` dict, and the base class does the
rest — which is also why a mapping authored for an XML and one authored for a
table produce the same shapes.

Namespaces are stripped from tags (`{http://ns}us` → `us`): a namespace is a fact
about the file, not about the field somebody mapped, and carrying it into every
path would make a mapping unreadable and file-specific.

Relations (`relations`) are applied after the rows, by the same rule the table
importers use — the value in the source column names the node the edge points at.
