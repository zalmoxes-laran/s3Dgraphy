"""CSV/TSV → graph, through the SAME rich mapping the other importers read.

The twin of `xml_importer.py`, and deliberately as small: it does **one** thing,
which is turn a delimited file into ROWS. Everything after that —
`column_mappings`, the roles, the properties, the paradata chain, the relations —
is `BaseImporter`'s, exactly as it is for a table read with pandas or for an XML
tree. A csv importer that re-implemented any of it would be a fourth place where
the mapping rules live, and the fourth copy is the one that goes stale.

Two small things it does have to know, because they are facts about the format
and about nothing else:

* **the delimiter**, sniffed rather than assumed — an Italian export is
  semicolon-separated more often than not, and a comma-only reader turns every
  row into one column with a very confusing name;
* **the encoding**, `utf-8-sig`, so a BOM written by Excel does not become part
  of the first column's name (`\\ufeffus` matches no mapping and the failure looks
  like a wrong mapping rather than a wrong byte).

Nothing else: no type coercion, no header normalisation, no NaN. A cell is the
text that was in it, and what it MEANS is the mapping's business.
