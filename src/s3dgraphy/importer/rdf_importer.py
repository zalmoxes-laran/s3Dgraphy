"""
RDF importer for s3Dgraphy graphs — the return leg of the triplestore.

``RDFExporter`` projects a property graph into CIDOC-CRM + HDT-O + EM; this
module reads that projection back. Together they make the triplestore a place
you can go INTO and come OUT of, which is what the CHANGELOG means by calling
it a persistent source of truth: a store you can only write to is an archive,
not a source.

**Same single source of truth, read by the same code.** The three datamodels
(``s3Dgraphy_node_datamodel.json``, ``s3Dgraphy_connections_datamodel.json``,
``em_qualia_types.json``) are loaded through the exporter's own ``_Datamodel``
class, and every map here is the INVERSE of a map built there. Nothing about
the EM language is written twice: if a class, an edge or a qualia term changes
in the JSON, both directions change with it.

How the three inversions are resolved — the interesting part, because none of
them is a plain dictionary flip:

* **IRI → node class.** An exported node carries several ``rdf:type``: its own
  em: class plus the CRM superclasses the exporter emits for CRM-only readers.
  Reading, we take the **most specific** class — the one that is a Python
  subclass of every other candidate — and the redundant superclasses fall away
  on their own. No namespace heuristic, no ordering assumption.

  Since 2026-08-11 the map is **bijective**: the six classes that used to share
  E1/E78/E53 have distinct ``em_extension.uri``, so 50 classes give 50 distinct
  IRIs. The evidence-based tie-break that used to separate the E53 pair is
  retained for legacy TTL only (see ``CLASS_EVIDENCE``).

* **predicate → edge_type.** The core CRM predicates are heavily many-to-one
  (nine of them carry two or more EM edges; ``P138i_has_representation`` carries
  four). Three things disambiguate, in order: the em: subproperty for the AP11
  physical family, the ``extension_mapping`` predicate where the datamodel
  declares one, and — the general answer — the **declared endpoints**
  (``allowed_connections``) matched against the classes of the two nodes the
  triple actually joins. That last one is why this does not need a hand-written
  table: the datamodel already says which edge can join which classes.

* **CIDOC class → property_type.** This inverse is genuinely ambiguous (27
  qualia share ``E54_Dimension``, 29 share ``E55_Type``), so it is NOT used as
  the primary route. The exporter states the qualia id explicitly in
  ``em:hasQualiaType``, and that is what is read. The class inverse remains as a
  fallback for third-party RDF, and where it is ambiguous it records a warning
  instead of picking one.

Named graphs: each ``<base>/graph/<graph_id>`` subject typed ``em:EMGraph``
becomes one s3Dgraphy ``Graph``. The graph id is recovered from that IRI rather
than from the RDF context, because a Turtle document has no contexts — so the
same reader handles TTL and TriG without a second code path.
