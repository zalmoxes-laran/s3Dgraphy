"""`create_annotation_paradata` — one annotation, as a paradata chain.

Determinism is the whole design here. The ids are `uuid5` over stable keys, so
calling this twice with the same annotation produces the SAME four nodes rather
than a second copy of them: a canvas that re-sends on every mouse-up, a batch
import run twice, or a sync that replays the same op all converge instead of
accumulating. That is also what makes the round-trip tests meaningful — the same
input projects to the same RDF, byte for byte.

The other decision worth stating: nothing here raises for a graph that does not
match expectations. A target that is not a stratigraphic unit, or an image that
is not in the graph, are things an author can do, and they produce WARNINGS plus
whatever part of the chain still makes sense. Refusing the whole annotation
because one anchor is odd would lose the interpretation someone just made — and
the interpretation is the part that cannot be reconstructed.

    image is a bare resource file.

    The problem, measured when the chain was first built: `extracted_from` takes
    a SOURCE (a `DocumentNode`), and the resource layer's file node is not one —
    so annotating a `ResourceNode` produced a chain with no extraction link at
    all. Two bad ways out were available and are NOT taken here:

      · widening `extracted_from` to `ResourceNode` — that would say a file is a
        source, and in EM it is not: a source is a thing somebody authored and
        can be cited, a resource is bytes on a disk;
      · converting the node's type — the resource is still a resource, and
        rewriting somebody's node under them is not a promotion, it is a loss.

    So the image is PROMOTED, not converted: a `DocumentNode` is minted beside it
    and linked to it with `has_linked_resource` (P67). The document is what the
    extraction cites; the resource stays what the region lives on. The two
    statements are different and now both exist:

        AnnotationRegion ──is_on_resource──────────────────────────────────▶ Resource
