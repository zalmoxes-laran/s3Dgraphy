"""
Hierarchical property resolvers for propagative metadata (DP-32).

A property declared on an Extended Matrix graph can live at three scope levels:

    node  >  swimlane (EpochNode)  >  graph (canvas header)

This subpackage exposes a generic 3-level resolver and a registry of
``PropagationRule`` objects. Each rule describes how to look up a specific
property at each level. Resolving a property walks the levels in order and
returns the first non-null value.

Built-in rules live in :mod:`s3dgraphy.resolvers.builtin_rules` and cover
chronology (``absolute_time_start``, ``absolute_time_end``) and authorship
(``author``). Consumers can register their own rules via
:func:`register_rule`.
