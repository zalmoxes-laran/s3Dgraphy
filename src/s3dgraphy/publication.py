"""Promotion: a working model becomes a PUBLISHED asset, referenced.

The inverse of `import_geometry` (CMD1), and the activation of DP-76. Until now
a 3D model lived *inside* the .blend: the file was both the workshop and the
archive, which is why a .blend grows to gigabytes and why nobody but its author
can point at what is in it.

Promotion separates the two. The mesh is exported once, in the canonical format
(glTF, what Heriverse/ATON read), published into the room's asset store, and the
graph stops carrying it: the ResourceNode becomes a **reference** — a URL and a
checksum — to bytes that live where everybody can reach them. The .blend stays
the hi-res container you work in; the asset of record is the published one.

**Nothing here is a new node type.** The ResourceNode already had `url`,
`checksum` and `residency` (SHELF1), and the genesis of a digital object already
had a shape: a `DTCProcessNode` (crmdig:D7) with `dtc_had_input` /
`dtc_had_output`. Promotion is those pieces, arranged — an "export" concept
invented for the occasion would have been a second vocabulary for a thing the
DTC already says.

What the event records is the sentence a reader needs: *this published asset was
produced, by this hand, at this time, from that working model.*

            promotion of something the graph did not know about is still a fact
            about an asset, and refusing it would only push the caller into
            making the node itself, badly.
        url: where the published bytes are (the room's asset endpoint).
        sha256: their digest, `sha256:<hex>` or the bare hex. It is what makes
            the reference verifiable: a URL alone says where to look, not what
            you should find.
        media_type: recorded as `resource_type` when given.
        residency: `reference` (default — the bytes are in a store the study
            points at) or `resident` (the ROOM's own store: em-server is in their
            path, so the gate and the licence travel with them). Both are true
            sentences about published bytes and the caller knows which one it is
            making; the default is the old one, so nothing already recorded
            changes meaning.
        corpus: the DOCUMENTATION member (`dtc.corpus`), when the promotion
            should be recorded there. This is the offline→online moment: a
            resource that was a file on somebody's disk becomes an asset in the
            store, and *how it got there* belongs in the corpus rather than in
            the middle of a stratigraphic matrix. The asset itself is mirrored
            into the corpus **under its own id** — the shared leaf — and the D7
            event is written THERE and not in the study graph.
        author / at: stamped on the event. The hand and the instant are the
            whole point of recording a genesis.
        source_id: the WORKING resource this was produced from, when there is
            one to name. Absent is honest — often the source is a .blend nobody
            has published, and inventing a node for it would put a thing in the
            graph that nobody can fetch.
        link_to: the node the published asset DEPICTS (typically the
            stratigraphic unit whose mesh was exported), attached with the
            existing `has_linked_resource` — the same hinge the shelf uses. An
            asset nothing points at is a file in a bucket.
