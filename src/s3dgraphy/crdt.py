"""P4.1 — the algebra that makes async and real-time the same thing.

The thesis (design note `EM_design_P4_realtime-collaborazione.md`): co-editing
does not need a NEW mechanism, it needs P3's dated merge promoted to a **CRDT**.
One model — operations keyed by UUID, tombstones, LWW-per-field with the
editorial stamps as clocks — answers BOTH "integrate later" (offline) and "we
are typing at the same time" (live). Async and real-time become the same thing
at two latencies.

This module is **only the algebra**: no server, no socket, no UI. It is provable
on a table — apply two op-logs in opposite orders and compare the digests — and
that is the whole point of doing it first.

Three pieces:

**Clocks.** ``(ts, author)`` — the editorial stamps EM already writes
(AUDIT1). Comparison is by instant, then by author, lexicographically smaller
first. The tie-break is arbitrary and DECLARED (``tie-author``); what it must
never be is "whichever I saw last", because then two people merging the same two
files get different projects and no way to tell.

**Tombstones.** A deletion is not an absence, it is a mark: ``data.removed =
{ts, by}``, inline, keeping the id. Views hide it; the merge SEES it. Without
this, delete-vs-edit silently resurrects the dead — two people, one deletes, one
edits, and the deletion evaporates because "absent" and "not yet known" look
identical.

**LWW-per-field.** A node is not one register but one per field. A changes the
description while B changes the dating: different fields, **both kept**. Same
field: the newer clock wins and the loser is REPORTED (it becomes awareness in
P4.3, not an error to resolve by hand). Field clocks are written LAZILY — only
where two versions actually diverged — so a node nobody fought over stays as
light as it was.

The unit of exchange is the **em.json node payload** (``{id, node_type, name,
description, data}``), which is also what `container.ts` works on: one shape, two
languages, and the canonical digest as the oracle that they agree.
