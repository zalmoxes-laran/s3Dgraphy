"""THE CONTRACT — what an adapter declares, and what happens when it acts.

One shape, two consumers. It was written once for the field assistant's tools
(design note §10: a partner adds a capability by writing a descriptor and a thin
adapter, and nothing in the assistant changes) and it turns out to be the same
shape a **connector** needs: EMtools in Blender, a Heriverse viewer, a Tropy
import, a PyArchInit sync. Both answer the same three questions —

    an adapter declares WHAT IT ANSWERS, WHAT IT NEEDS, and WHAT IT CHANGES.

so both live here, and the two registries above are thin specialisations
(:mod:`s3dgraphy.contract.connector` for connectors; the chatbot's
``ToolRegistry`` for tools). Writing it twice would have produced two contracts
that agree today and diverge on the first refusal somebody adds to one of them.

**The four refusals** are the substance, and each is a decision about what an
adapter must never be allowed to do:

1. **unknown op** → *I cannot do that*, naming what exists. Not an exception:
   being asked for something that does not exist is a normal turn;
2. **declared but not wired** (no handler) → said plainly, because a descriptor
   without an adapter is a real state during an integration and pretending
   otherwise wastes somebody's afternoon;
3. **missing slot** → named, never defaulted. The one that matters most: a field
   assistant that invented a unit number, or a connector that invented a room,
   writes something nobody can detect later;
4. **a write with no author** → refused. Everything that enters a graph is
   attributed to a verifiable identity; an unattributed record is one nobody can
   defend, which is the whole reason ORCID is in this design.

**Purity is part of the contract.** Nothing here imports a network client, a
framework or a graph implementation: an adapter's handler closes over whatever it
needs. That is what lets this module be tested on a field node with no network,
and what keeps a partner from having to learn our dependency injection.
