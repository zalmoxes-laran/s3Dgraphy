"""CONNECTORS — the contract, specialised for a tool that plugs into a study.

A connector is an **adapter that declares a descriptor and speaks the common
wire**: em.json for the document, a content-addressed object store for the bytes,
CRDT ops for the changes — and every write attributed as a DTC act. Blender
(EMtools) is reference #1; a Heriverse viewer, a Tropy import and a PyArchInit
sync are the next three, and none of them should require a line of this file to
change. That is the test of whether this is a contract or a hub with a shape.

What this adds to :mod:`s3dgraphy.contract.core`:

* **where it runs** (``host``) — inside another application (Blender, QGIS) or
  inside EMStudio itself. It decides who initiates, and it is declared rather
  than inferred because the same capability (say ``publish-3D``) means a
  different thing on each side;
* **how it reaches us** (``transport``) — direct (a socket on this machine), lan
  (a paired host on the network), cloud (through a room on em-server). A
  connector lists what it CAN do; the session picks;
* **what it speaks** (``versions``) — the em.json schema, the connections
  datamodel, this connector API. The handshake below refuses a mismatch with the
  reason instead of letting a stale peer write half-understood edges;
* **what it does** (``capabilities``) — from a CLOSED set, grouped by layer, so a
  registry can group them and a reader can tell a document capability from an
  ephemeral one.

**The four refusals are the core's**, unchanged. Two more guards live here
because they are about a graph rather than about an act:

* a ``write-graph`` passes the connections datamodel (``allowed_connections``)
  **at the seam**, before anything enters: a connector that speaks a slightly
  different EM would otherwise fill a study with `generic_connection`;
* an ``ingest-batch`` proposes a **volatile** delta. It is in the graph and NOT
  in the document until somebody bakes it, which is the residency machinery
  (:mod:`s3dgraphy.dtc.residency`) — because "a folder arrived" is a proposal and
  "these files are in the study" is a decision a person makes.

**Trust is not declared here.** A connector inherits the role of the user or of
the room it arrived through (a viewer does not write). This module never grants a
capability; it refuses one that was not declared, and the room refuses one the
role does not carry.

    The section (not a :class:`~s3dgraphy.graph.Graph`) because that is the wire:
    em.json for the document, CRDT ops for the changes. Each node and edge is
    applied with :func:`s3dgraphy.crdt.apply_op_to_section`, so a connector gets
    the same idempotence, the same field clocks and the same stale-op refusal as
    every other writer — there is no second applier to keep in step.

    ``volatile`` defaults to the delta's own flag (an ``ingest-batch`` proposes;
    a ``write-graph`` records). A volatile write is marked and stays out of
    :func:`document_view` until :func:`bake`.

    Returns the guard's refusal unchanged when it refuses — nothing is applied,
    so a rejected write cannot leave half a subgraph behind.
