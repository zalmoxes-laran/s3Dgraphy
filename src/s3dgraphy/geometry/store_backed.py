"""Which geometry a graph describes that actually LIVES in the store.

The second half of DP-76. The first half taught a working model to become a
published asset (`publication.promote_resource`, `put_asset`); this is the
question the consuming side asks: *of everything this graph says exists in three
dimensions, what can I fetch right now?*

It belongs in the library and not in EMtools for the reason every walk does: the
graph knows the shape of its own statements, and a consumer that re-derived them
would drift the day a facet is added. Blender should ask "what is there?" and
receive a list — not walk `has_linked_resource` itself and discover next year
that RMSF exists.

**Resident only, and that is a design line, not a shortcut.** A `resident`
resource is bytes in the room's content-addressed store: em-server is in their
path, so the embargo gate and the licence header apply to them, and a digest is
enough to fetch them from anywhere. A `reference` resource is somebody's NAS or
somebody's laptop: the graph knows a locator, nothing can verify it from here,
and materialising it would mean reading a path that is meaningful on one machine
only. Those stay exactly as they are, and this list says so by leaving them out.

What counts as geometry is decided by the RESOURCE's own recorded kind
(`url_type` / `resource_type` / `media_type`), never by the extension of a
string: a `.glb` that nobody recorded as a model is still a model, and a `.json`
called `mesh.json` is not one.

Tombstones are skipped — a removed RM is not geometry to materialise, and a
removed epoch is not a target to bind to.
