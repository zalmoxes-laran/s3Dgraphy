"""What a study says about ITSELF — the card a catalogue derives from a container.

The Catalog's founding decision (StratiGraph_Catalog_SPEC_per_3DR §1–2, and the
runner that made it executable): **the unit of the catalogue is the STUDY, and a
study is one em.json container**. The container is the truth; the catalogue's
index is a **projection** of it, rebuildable by re-reading the containers. This
module is the seam that makes that sentence true rather than aspirational —
without it, an indexer would have to know where a licence lives, and the day it
guessed wrong the index would be a second, disagreeing truth.

**Nothing here is a new node type, and nothing is invented.** Authorship,
licence and embargo already live as **graph-scope nodes** (DP-65 / MIG1-A: a
`GraphNode` owning a `ParadataNodeGroup` whose members are `AuthorNode` /
`LicenseNode` / `EmbargoNode`); the HDT view already has its vocabulary
(HDT-O: `HeritageEntityNode` = HC1, `HDTNode` = HC2, `StudyNode` = HC9); the
version already travels beside the header (P3 `ProjectVersion`) and the site
position already sits on the graph-self node (GEO1). This function READS those
and puts them in one shape. The spec says it in one line — the Catalog *exposes
and indexes* them, it does not reinvent them.

**A missing field is missing.** Every key of the card is always present (an
index needs a stable schema) and its value is `None` / `[]` when the container
does not say. Nothing is defaulted into existence: a study without a licence
must READ as a study without a licence, because "CC-BY" invented by a reader is
a licence nobody granted.

The one thing that IS computed: `checksum`, the container's content digest
(`container.content_digest`) — the same oracle P3 uses to decide whether a save
is a new version. It is what lets a catalogue answer "is the copy I indexed
still the copy you have".

Precedence, stated once because a reader of an index deserves to know where a
value came from:

* **title** — `header.title`, else the active graph's name, else its id;
* **authors / license / embargo** — the graph-scope NODES (DP-65) of every
  member graph, in member order; the legacy `graph.data` spellings
  (`authors`, `license`, `embargo_until`) are read only as a fallback, so a
  container written before MIG1-A still catalogues;
* **visibility** — `header.visibility`, normalised, defaulting to
  **restricted**: a study served too openly cannot be un-served;
* **version** — the container's `ProjectVersion` (top level, NOT the header:
  the header describes the FORMAT, the version describes the WORK);
* **hc1 / hc2** — the HDT-O nodes, if the study carries them;
* **spatial** — `GraphNode.data.site_position` (GEO1), which is the SITE, not
  the georeferencing shift.
