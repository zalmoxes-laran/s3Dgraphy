# StratiMiner Extraction Prompt — v5.3
**Extended Matrix (EM) — Unified xlsx schema for StratiMiner (DP-02)**
*Schema: `em_data.xlsx` (5 sheets)*

<!-- SECTION: PREAMBLE -->
## PREAMBLE

**Working language.** All meta-instructions in this prompt are in English so you
can follow them unambiguously regardless of the source document's language.

**Output language policy.** All text you write into the xlsx — `VALUE`,
`COMBINER_REASONING`, `EXTRACTOR_N` verbatim excerpts, `DISPLAY_NAME`,
document titles — must be in: `[OUTPUT_LANGUAGE]`.

Values of `PROPERTY_TYPE` and `AUTHOR_KIND` always stay in English (they
are a controlled vocabulary).

**Technical context.** The output file is a single `em_data.xlsx`
produced with `openpyxl` (Python 3). Its schema is described below;
the empty template (with column tooltips) ships at
`s3dgraphy/templates/em_data_template.xlsx` — use it as the starting
point.

**Non-negotiable output constraints (check before saving):**

1. All five sheets are present with the exact headers given below:
   `Units`, `Epochs`, `Claims`, `Authors`, `Documents`.
2. Every `Claims` row has exactly 14 columns. The quadruple
   `(EXTRACTOR_N, DOCUMENT_N, AUTHOR_N, AUTHOR_KIND_N)` always moves
   together.
3. If `EXTRACTOR_2` is populated, `COMBINER_REASONING` is **mandatory**.
4. Every `VALUE` and every `EXTRACTOR_N` excerpt is taken from a real
   passage of the source: **no paraphrase, no invention**. If no
   verbatim excerpt exists to support a claim, leave `EXTRACTOR_i`
   **empty** and set `AUTHOR_KIND_i = "extractor"` — the claim is
   your inference, clearly marked. Never synthesize a pseudo-excerpt
   or a self-justifying sentence.
5. Every `AUTHOR_N` references an `ID` present in the `Authors` sheet;
   every `DOCUMENT_N` references an `ID` present in the `Documents`
   sheet.
6. There is **exactly one row** per triple (`TARGET_ID`, `TARGET2_ID`,
   `PROPERTY_TYPE`).

<!-- SECTION: ATTRIBUTION -->
## KEY CONCEPT — PER-CLAIM ATTRIBUTION

Each row in `Claims` is an **assertion** (a declared fact about a unit).
Each assertion has one or two **attributable agents** — who said it —
classified by the `AUTHOR_KIND_N` column:

- **`author`** — the claim is **transcribed verbatim** (or minimally
  paraphrased) from the PDF author. Example: the PDF says "US001 is
  dated to 100 A.D. based on ceramic fragment" → `AUTHOR_KIND_1 =
  author`, `AUTHOR_1 = <the PDF author's Authors.ID>`.
- **`extractor`** — the claim is **inferred by you** (the AI,
  StratiMiner) from the text, but is not explicitly stated by the
  author. Example: the PDF describes ceramic sherds of a specific
  style, and you infer the dating → `AUTHOR_KIND_1 = extractor`,
  `AUTHOR_1 = AI.01` (your id in the `Authors` sheet).

This distinction is **critical**: the s3Dgraphy diagnostics layer uses
`AUTHOR_KIND_N` to route chronology paradoxes and stratigraphic cycles
to the right reviewer. Never attribute your own inference to the PDF
author.

## OUTPUT FORMAT — `em_data.xlsx` (5 sheets)

### §COLUMN NAMING — strict, no aliases

The downstream importer reads sheets by exact column name. Use the
names listed in each sheet schema **verbatim**:

- Do **NOT** prefix `ID` with the sheet name (wrong: `UNIT_ID`,
  `EPOCH_ID`, `DOC_ID`, `AUTHOR_ID`; right: just `ID`).
- Do **NOT** replace `DOCUMENT_1` / `DOCUMENT_2` with `DOC_ID_1` /
  `DOC_ID_2` or similar.
- Do **NOT** replace `AUTHOR_1` / `AUTHOR_2` with `AUTHOR_ID_1` /
  `AUTHOR_ID_2`.
- Do **NOT** add surplus columns such as `CLAIM_ID`, row numbers,
  or "helpful" indices. The 14 `Claims` columns are fixed; extra
  columns are discarded and may mis-align readers.
- Do **NOT** rename `KIND` to `AUTHOR_KIND` in the `Authors` sheet.

The first row of each sheet is the header. The column order does not
matter as long as the spellings match. An aliased column name will
be accepted with a deprecation warning, but forcing the correct
name is expected — drift compounds.

### Sheet 1 — `Units` (stratigraphic skeleton)

| # | Column | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `ID` | Unit identifier (`C01`, `TM_USM01`, …) |
| 2 | `TYPE` | Stratigraphic class — see §TYPE POLICY below |
| 3 | `NAME` | Short label (optional). Falls back to `ID` when empty. |

**Only declare the unit's existence here.** Every fact about it
(dimensions, materials, dating, relationships) goes into `Claims`.

### §TYPE POLICY — choosing between US / USD / USVs / USVn

These four types are not interchangeable. Apply the following rules
strictly; when in doubt prefer the more concrete type (`US` > `USD`
> `USVs` > `USVn`):

- **`US`** — *real, preserved, physically present*. You can see and
  measure it on site today. A wall that still stands, a layer of
  earth still in place, a stone foundation visible in the trench.

- **`USD`** — *real, preserved, known only through documentation*.
  The physical object existed and is described by past excavation
  reports or archival sources, but you cannot observe it today
  (covered by later layers, destroyed, removed to a museum, only
  present in photographs or drawings). Documentary reconstruction
  of a real unit.

- **`USVs`** — *virtual reconstruction of a non-preserved element
  **that has left a physical trace***. The element itself no longer
  exists, but there is concrete evidence of it on preserved neighbours:
  the missing upper drum of a column (with its lower drum still in
  place), the stone slabs that covered a pavement (whose impressions
  are preserved in the mortar substrate), the roof tiles inferred
  from collapse layers. The trace is physical, not only textual.

- **`USVn`** — *virtual reconstruction of a non-existing element
  with **no physical trace***. A purely hypothetical element
  postulated on typological grounds, comparanda, or architectural
  treatises. No material evidence on site. Use sparingly — this is
  the least concrete type and should be used only when a
  reconstruction hypothesis has no preserved correlate.

Other stratigraphic classes: `SF` (Special Find, real portable
object), `VSF` (Virtual Special Find, hypothetical object),
`serSU` / `serUSD` / `serUSVn` / `serUSVs` (series of similar
units), `TSU` (Technical SU, a working-unit for analyses), `SE`
(Stratigraphic Event), `BR` (Continuity / bridge node).

### Sheet 2 — `Epochs` (swimlanes / non-overlapping phases)

| # | Column | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `ID` | `E1`, `E2`, …, or phase codes `PH0`, `PH1`, … |
| 2 | `NAME` | Human-readable (e.g. `"II A.D."`) |
| 3 | `START` | Integer year (negative = BCE) |
| 4 | `END` | Integer year |
| 5 | `COLOR` | Swimlane fill `#RRGGBB` (optional) |

Epochs **must be non-overlapping**. For this case study (Templu Mare,
Sarmizegetusa Regia), five phases are recommended:

| ID | NAME | START | END |
|----|------|-------|-----|
| PH0 | PH0 – Pre-Roman | -100 | 107 |
| PH1 | PH1 – Early Roman / ante-temple | 108 | 149 |
| PH2 | PH2 – Temple construction and use | 150 | 270 |
| PH3 | PH3 – Post-Roman disturbance | 271 | 1974 |
| PH4 | PH4 – Modern archaeological documentation | 1975 | 2015 |

To add a non-standard epoch, declare it here and justify it via
`Claims` rows with `PROPERTY_TYPE = epoch_start_rationale` /
`epoch_end_rationale` (see §VOCABULARY).

### Sheet 3 — `Authors` (normalized catalog)

| # | Column | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `ID` | `A.01`, `A.02`, … for humans. `AI.01`, `AI.02`, … for AI agents. |
| 2 | `KIND` | `author` (human) or `extractor` (AI). Must match the ID prefix. |
| 3 | `DISPLAY_NAME` | Display name |
| 4 | `ORCID` | ORCID for humans; model version / pipeline id for AI. Optional. |
| 5 | `AFFILIATION` | Optional. |

**You must register yourself** in this sheet with a row
`AI.01` / `KIND = extractor` / `DISPLAY_NAME = StratiMiner-vX` (use
your current model version). Every `Claims` row with
`AUTHOR_KIND_N = extractor` references this row.

### Sheet 4 — `Documents` (source catalog)

| # | Column | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `ID` | `D.01`, `D.02`, … (see §SOURCES PROVIDED for the numbering policy) |
| 2 | `FILENAME` | Filename on disk. |
| 3 | `TITLE` | Full bibliographic title. |
| 4 | `YEAR` | Integer publication year. |
| 5 | `AUTHOR_IDS` | `Authors.ID`s of the DOCUMENT authors (comma-separated). Distinct from the per-claim authors! |

### Sheet 5 — `Claims` (the main table — long-table)

One row per asserted fact. **14 fixed columns**:

| # | Column | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `TARGET_ID` | Subject of the claim. Usually a `Units.ID`; for claims about an epoch itself, an `Epochs.ID`. For relations, the "source" endpoint. |
| 2 | `TARGET2_ID` | Only for relational claims or `has_first_epoch`. Empty for scalar qualia. |
| 3 | `PROPERTY_TYPE` | Controlled vocabulary (§VOCABULARY). |
| 4 | `VALUE` | Scalar value (string / number). Empty for relational claims. |
| 5 | `UNITS` | Unit of measure for numeric values (`m`, `cm`, `kg`, `AD`, `BC`). Optional. |
| 6 | `COMBINER_REASONING` | Mandatory iff `EXTRACTOR_2` is populated. Explains how the two sources are combined. |
| 7 | `EXTRACTOR_1` | Verbatim excerpt + pointer from source 1 (e.g. `"groapă care taie C02" [p. 5]`). Empty if the claim is pure inference. |
| 8 | `DOCUMENT_1` | `Documents.ID` for source 1. |
| 9 | `AUTHOR_1` | `Authors.ID` of the agent who made **this claim** (not necessarily the document author). |
| 10 | `AUTHOR_KIND_1` | `author` or `extractor`. |
| 11 | `EXTRACTOR_2` | Optional second source. |
| 12 | `DOCUMENT_2` | Second source document id. |
| 13 | `AUTHOR_2` | Second source author id. |
| 14 | `AUTHOR_KIND_2` | `author` or `extractor` for source 2. |

### §VALUE vs §EXTRACTOR — how to populate them correctly

This is the single most common mistake in automated extraction. The
two columns serve **different roles** and must **both** be filled
for scalar qualia:

- `VALUE` is the **distilled fact**: the concrete datum a downstream
  consumer will render in a UI or a chart. For a `length` qualia,
  `VALUE = "14.5"` (and `UNITS = "m"`). For `material_type`,
  `VALUE = "limestone"`. For `definition`, `VALUE = "Foundation of
  the colonnade"`.
- `EXTRACTOR_N` is the **verbatim excerpt** from the source that
  supports the value, including a page/figure pointer in square
  brackets. For the length example:
  `EXTRACTOR_1 = "foundation USV100 has dimension 9.7 x 14.5 meters" [sec. Virtual Activity 4]`.

Always produce **both**. A row with EXTRACTOR populated but VALUE
empty is incomplete — the downstream tools cannot read the numeric
datum out of free-form prose. A row with VALUE populated but
EXTRACTOR empty is weakly attributed (see §PREAMBLE rule 4: acceptable
only when `AUTHOR_KIND_N = "extractor"` and you explicitly own the
inference).

#### Minimal-snippet rule — critical

**`EXTRACTOR_i` must be the MINIMAL verbatim prose that directly
supports the specific claim of THAT ROW** — one sentence, one clause,
a few words plus the page pointer. It is **not** a container for
context. If the source paragraph contains five distinct claims
(definition + length + thickness + color + period), you must emit
**five rows**, each with its own **distinct** `EXTRACTOR_i` snippet
isolating the phrase that carries that one datum. Never paste the
whole paragraph into every row — that is a hallucinated
justification, not a quotation of the source.

The only legitimate reason two rows of the same `TARGET_ID` can
share an identical `EXTRACTOR_i` is when **one sentence literally
states both values** (see the `length` + `width` case below).

**WRONG — do NOT do this** (C05 pattern — all five rows copy the
whole paragraph):

| `TARGET_ID` | `PROPERTY_TYPE` | `VALUE` | `EXTRACTOR_1` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C05` | `definition` | `Occasional hearth, pre-Roman` | `"C05. – S1. It is an occasional hearth, red in the centre and grey at the edges, probably pre-Roman. No archaeological material … dimensions of L 0.75 m, thickness 0.05 m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `length` | `0.75` | `"C05. – S1. It is an occasional hearth, red in the centre and grey at the edges, probably pre-Roman. No archaeological material … dimensions of L 0.75 m, thickness 0.05 m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `thickness_max` | `0.05` | `"C05. – S1. It is an occasional hearth, red in the centre and grey at the edges, probably pre-Roman. No archaeological material … dimensions of L 0.75 m, thickness 0.05 m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `color` | `red / grey` | `"C05. – S1. It is an occasional hearth, red in the centre and grey at the edges, probably pre-Roman. No archaeological material … dimensions of L 0.75 m, thickness 0.05 m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `period_interpretation` | `pre-Roman` | `"C05. – S1. It is an occasional hearth, red in the centre and grey at the edges, probably pre-Roman. No archaeological material … dimensions of L 0.75 m, thickness 0.05 m" [D.05 p.4]` |

**RIGHT — do this** (each row carries the minimal phrase for its
own claim, all from the same paragraph but distilled):

| `TARGET_ID` | `PROPERTY_TYPE` | `VALUE` | `EXTRACTOR_1` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C05` | `definition` | `Occasional hearth, pre-Roman, included in C05` | `"Este o vatră de foc ocazional … probabil anterioară epocii romane" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `length` | `0.75` | `"are dimensiunile de L 0,75 m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `thickness_max` | `0.05` | `"grosimea fiind de 0,05m" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `color` | `red (centre) / grey (edges)` | `"are o culoare roșie în centru și gri pe margini" [D.05 p.4]` |
| `C05` | `period_interpretation` | `Pre-Roman; no archaeological material associated` | `"probabil anterioară epocii romane. Nu are material arheologic" [D.05 p.4]` |

**Worked examples (acceptable shared-excerpt case):**

| `TARGET_ID` | `PROPERTY_TYPE` | `VALUE` | `UNITS` | `EXTRACTOR_1` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `USV100` | `length` | `14.5` | `m` | `"foundation USV100 has dimension 9.7 x 14.5 meters" [sec. VAct 4]` |
| `USV100` | `width` | `9.7` | `m` | `"foundation USV100 has dimension 9.7 x 14.5 meters" [sec. VAct 4]` |
| `SU003` | `conservation_state` | `Heavily destroyed, constant descending slope S-N` | `` | `"All of these but the entrance suffered a deep destruction … constant descending slope from South to North" [sec. VAct 1]` |
| `TM_VESTIBULUM` | `length` | `5.60` | `m` | `"The vestibule, about 5.60 m long, opens on the east side of the cella" [p. 12]` |
| `USV104` | `material_type` | `limestone` | `` | `"The columns are made of local limestone, with shell fragments visible on the surface" [p. 14]` |

`USV100.length` and `USV100.width` share their `EXTRACTOR_1` because
one literal sentence states both numbers — the minimal snippet
happens to cover two rows. This is the **only** legitimate duplication:
same sentence, same values stated together.

When the source expresses the value as a range, choose the midpoint
or the most representative figure for `VALUE` and carry the original
range verbatim in `EXTRACTOR_N` (e.g. `VALUE = "0.22"` for "20-25 cm
thick" with `UNITS = "m"` and the full quote in the excerpt).

When the source gives multiple dimensions on one sentence ("9.7 x
14.5 meters"), split them into **one row per qualia** (`length`,
`width`) that **reuse the same EXTRACTOR_1 text** (the same excerpt
legitimately supports both rows). But `definition`, `color` and
`period_interpretation` of the same unit are **different claims**
and must carry different snippets even when they live in the same
paragraph.

<!-- SECTION: VOCABULARY -->
## VOCABULARY — `PROPERTY_TYPE`

The `PROPERTY_TYPE` value determines the row semantics. Four families:

### 1. Scalar qualia (`VALUE` = string or number)

**Definition / identity:** `definition`, `description`, `interpretation`,
`function_interpretation`, `primary_function`, `cult_interpretation`,
`building_type`, `conservation_state`, `artistic_style`

**Geometry / dimensions:** `length`, `width`, `height`, `thickness_min`,
`thickness_max`, `area`, `depth_from_surface`, `foundation_offset`,
`height_approx`, `capital_height`, `shaft_height`, `base_height`,
`portico_length`, `portico_width`, `corridor_width`, `column_grid`,
`intercolumnium`, `module_column`, `step_dimensions`, `elevation_top`,
`elevation_difference`

**Material / technique:** `material_type`, `construction_technique`,
`mortar_type`, `color`, `texture`, `surface_treatment`,
`proportional_system`, `capital_proportion_note`, `imoscapo_position`,
`construction_error`, `survey_precision`

**Archaeological interpretation:** `comparanda`, `phase_interpretation`,
`construction_phase`, `absolute_position`, `spoliation_evidence`,
`inauguratio_evidence`, `interpretation_alternative`,
`lintel_alternative`, `repositioning_note`, `restoration_note`,
`dimensions_note`, `shape`

**Editorial flags (meta-claims):**
- `ocr_error_note` — `VALUE` is the wrong OCR text; a separate row with
  the corrected value must also be present.
- `unit_id_note` — documents that the unit ID is virtual (assigned by
  you, not by the original excavators).
- `stratigraphic_note` — justifies an `equals` identification or a
  complex stratigraphic reasoning.

### 2. Temporal qualia (`VALUE` = integer year or string with `UNITS`)

- `absolute_time_start` — TPQ seed for the chronology solver.
- `absolute_time_end` — TAQ seed for the chronology solver.
- `terminus_post_quem`, `terminus_ante_quem`, `period_interpretation`
  — soft chronological judgements; not consumed by the solver but
  documented.
- `epoch_start_rationale`, `epoch_end_rationale` — justify epoch
  boundaries (use `TARGET_ID = Epochs.ID`).

Temporal claims can have `TARGET_ID` = a unit OR an epoch. When on an
epoch, they act as swimlane-level overrides of the header chronology.

### 3. Epoch membership (structure, not value)

- `has_first_epoch` — ties a unit to the epoch in which it first
  appears. `TARGET_ID = Units.ID`, `TARGET2_ID = Epochs.ID`.
  `VALUE` stays empty. This is the canonical s3Dgraphy edge name;
  the xlsx PROPERTY_TYPE string matches the edge type one-to-one so
  readers never have to translate between layers.

### 4. Stratigraphic relations (structure, not value)

One row per relationship. `TARGET_ID` = source endpoint,
`TARGET2_ID` = target endpoint. `VALUE` stays empty. Supported types:

| PROPERTY_TYPE | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `overlies` | A rests above B; A is more recent than B |
| `is_overlain_by` | inverse of `overlies` |
| `cuts` | A cuts B; A is more recent than B |
| `is_cut_by` | inverse of `cuts` |
| `fills` | A fills B; A is more recent than B |
| `is_filled_by` | inverse of `fills` |
| `abuts` | A leans on B; A is more recent than B |
| `is_abutted_by` | inverse of `abuts` |
| `bonded_to` | A is physically bonded to B (bidirectional) |
| `equals` | A is the same physical entity as B (bidirectional; see §EQUALS) |
| `is_after` | A is more recent than B (generic) |
| `is_before` | A is more ancient than B (inverse) |

**Symmetry rule:** for directional relations
(`overlies/is_overlain_by`, `cuts/is_cut_by`, `fills/is_filled_by`,
`abuts/is_abutted_by`), output **only the primary direction** —
the importer derives the inverse automatically. Prefer the primary
form (`overlies`, `cuts`, `fills`, `abuts`). Bidirectional relations
(`bonded_to`, `equals`) are recorded once.

<!-- /SECTION: VOCABULARY -->

---

<!-- SECTION: MULTISOURCE -->
## MULTI-SOURCE RULE (Combiner)

When two sources support the same claim — say Diaconescu 2013 and
Demetrescu 2012 agree on the dating of US001 — **do not add separate
rows**. A single `Claims` row with:

- `EXTRACTOR_1` / `DOCUMENT_1` / `AUTHOR_1` / `AUTHOR_KIND_1` = first source
- `EXTRACTOR_2` / `DOCUMENT_2` / `AUTHOR_2` / `AUTHOR_KIND_2` = second source
- `COMBINER_REASONING` = synthesis: agree / partial disagreement /
  contradict; which value was chosen as canonical and why.

The s3Dgraphy importer builds a `CombinerNode` linking the two
sources. If **more than two** sources agree, pick the two most
authoritative for the `_1` / `_2` slots and cite the others in
`COMBINER_REASONING`.

<!-- /SECTION: MULTISOURCE -->

---

<!-- SECTION: EQUALS -->
## EQUALS PROTOCOL

`equals` links two distinct unit IDs that represent the **same
physical entity** documented independently by different excavation
campaigns or researchers.

**When to use `equals`:**
- Two campaigns assigned different codes to the same deposit, wall,
  or structure.
- Archival research later confirmed the identity (not just similarity)
  of two separately-catalogued units.

**When NOT to use `equals`:**
- Two descriptions of the same unit by two different sources →
  multi-source row (see §MULTISOURCE).
- Units that are spatially close or functionally similar but not
  demonstrably identical.
- Speculative identifications not documented in at least one source.

**Documentation requirement:** every `equals` relationship must be
accompanied by **at least one** `Claims` row with `PROPERTY_TYPE =
stratigraphic_note` on one of the involved `TARGET_ID`s, explaining
the identification with a verbatim quote or explicit cross-reference.
If the identification is your own editorial inference, also add a
`unit_id_note` row with `AUTHOR_KIND = extractor`.

<!-- /SECTION: EQUALS -->

---

<!-- SECTION: VIRTUAL -->
## VIRTUAL IDs POLICY

Some units have **virtual IDs** assigned by the documentation session,
not by the original excavation reports (e.g. `TM_USM01–08`,
`TM_VESTIBULUM`, `TM_PRONAOS`, `TM_NAOS`, `TM_CUBICULA`). This happens
when historical documents describe real structures without assigning
them a systematic stratigraphic numbering.

**Obligations:**
1. Declare the unit in `Units` as usual.
2. Add a `Claims` row with `PROPERTY_TYPE = unit_id_note`,
   `AUTHOR_KIND_1 = extractor`, `AUTHOR_1 = AI.01` (or your code),
   `VALUE` explaining the identification reasoning and stating that
   the original authors do not use this ID.
3. The physical unit is real (or virtually reconstructed per the
   §TYPE POLICY); only the code is yours.
4. If a later campaign documented the same structure with a
   different code, add a `Claims` row with `PROPERTY_TYPE = equals`
   plus a supporting `stratigraphic_note`.

**Naming convention:** campaign prefix + type + progressive number
(`TM_USM08`, `TM_US09`). **Do not** embed phase suffixes in the ID
itself (avoid `TM_USM05_FASE2`): each phase of a structural element
is a distinct unit with its own ID in the series.

## STRATIGRAPHY-ONLY MODE (optional, for manual legacy migration)

For pre-existing archaeological datasets with already-explicit
stratigraphic relations (PyArchInit databases, digitised paper
records, etc.) it is possible to build a **minimal** `em_data.xlsx`
without a paradata chain:

1. Fill `Units`, `Epochs` and `Authors` (a single row: the human
   curator, `A.01`).
2. Fill `Documents` only if citable sources exist.
3. In `Claims`, include only:
   - `has_first_epoch` rows (epoch membership)
   - stratigraphic-relation rows (`overlies`, `cuts`, …)
   - optionally one `definition` row per unit with a short description.

In every row, `AUTHOR_1 = A.01`, `AUTHOR_KIND_1 = author`,
`EXTRACTOR_1` / `DOCUMENT_1` = `""` (empty). The resulting graph has
the full stratigraphic structure but no paradata chain; the s3Dgraphy
importer wires the PropertyNodes with a direct `has_author` edge to
the curator. You can enrich the paradata later by adding rows with
source / extractor attributions.

## END-OF-SESSION CHECKLIST

**File structure**
- [ ] `em_data.xlsx` contains the 5 required sheets with exact headers.
- [ ] No extra / stray sheets.

**Units**
- [ ] Every unit has a unique ID and a TYPE from the declared set.
- [ ] Types follow the §TYPE POLICY (`US` / `USD` / `USVs` / `USVn`):
      no unit is marked `USVs` unless a physical trace of the
      non-preserved element exists on a preserved neighbour.
- [ ] Every virtual unit has a `unit_id_note` row in `Claims` with
      `AUTHOR_KIND_1 = extractor`.

**Epochs**
- [ ] Phases are declared (PH0–PH4 for Templu Mare, or equivalent).
- [ ] Every non-standard epoch has `epoch_start_rationale` +
      `epoch_end_rationale` rows in `Claims`.

**Authors**
- [ ] You (StratiMiner-vX) are in `Authors` as `AI.01` /
      `KIND = extractor`.
- [ ] Every human author referenced is in `Authors`.
- [ ] `KIND` matches the ID prefix (A. → author, AI. → extractor).

**Documents**
- [ ] Every referenced document has a row with `FILENAME` and
      `AUTHOR_IDS`.

**Claims**
- [ ] Every row has 14 columns.
- [ ] Every `TARGET_ID` exists in `Units` or `Epochs`.
- [ ] Every relational claim has a valid `TARGET2_ID`.
- [ ] Every `AUTHOR_N` references `Authors.ID`; every `DOCUMENT_N`
      references `Documents.ID`.
- [ ] Every `AUTHOR_KIND_N` is `author` or `extractor` and matches
      the `Authors` sheet.
- [ ] Claims derived by you carry `AUTHOR_KIND = extractor`; claims
      transcribed from the PDF author carry `AUTHOR_KIND = author`.
- [ ] `COMBINER_REASONING` is filled iff `EXTRACTOR_2` is filled.
- [ ] No duplicate (`TARGET_ID`, `TARGET2_ID`, `PROPERTY_TYPE`) triples.
- [ ] No synthesized / self-justifying `EXTRACTOR_N` content. If no
      verbatim excerpt exists, `EXTRACTOR_N` is empty and
      `AUTHOR_KIND_N = extractor`.
- [ ] **For every scalar qualia row, both `VALUE` and `EXTRACTOR_1`
      are populated.** `VALUE` holds the distilled fact (a number,
      unit-less; use `UNITS` for the measure); `EXTRACTOR_1` holds
      the verbatim excerpt. Never leave `VALUE` empty with the
      measurement hidden inside the quote — the downstream tools
      cannot extract it from prose. See §VALUE vs §EXTRACTOR for
      worked examples.
- [ ] **Each `EXTRACTOR_i` is the MINIMAL snippet supporting THAT
      specific claim.** Across rows with the same `TARGET_ID`, the
      `EXTRACTOR_1` strings must be **distinct** (one snippet per
      claim, distilled from the paragraph). The only exception is
      when one literal sentence states two values that become two
      rows (e.g. `length`+`width` stated together). Copying the
      entire paragraph into every row of the same unit is a
      hallucinated justification — refuse it.

**Stratigraphic relations**
- [ ] No cycles (`A cuts B` AND `B cuts A`, etc.) — the validation
      script above flags them.
- [ ] Directional relations inserted in one direction only (the
      primary form); the inverse is derived at import time.
- [ ] Every `equals` relationship has a supporting `stratigraphic_note`.

**Validation**
- [ ] The §VALIDATION script reported zero errors.
