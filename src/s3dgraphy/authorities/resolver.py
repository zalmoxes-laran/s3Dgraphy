"""Offline-first authority resolver (P1-D).

Resolves a free-text term for a given facet (WHEN / WHAT / WHERE / WHO) against
OFFLINE JSON-LD snapshots bundled in ``authorities/snapshots/`` and returns a
RANKED list of candidates — **redundant by design**: every hit is attached, not
just the best one, ranked by an ordered consumption list per facet.

Design (decisions by E.D.):
  * Offline-first. Online enrichment is an optional hook, OFF by default
    (``online=True`` raises — not implemented in P1-D, no network here).
  * Strength-aware match: exact label hit → ``"exact"`` (→ skos:exactMatch on
    export); anything looser → ``"close"`` (→ skos:closeMatch, the default).
    The resolver NEVER emits an identity match — ``owl:sameAs`` is reserved for
    a human explicitly confirming identity (``match="sameAs"``), never for a
    ranked/uncertain candidate.
  * The registry is a DATA asset (JSON-LD snapshots), not code — like
    ``em_qualia_types.json``. em.json stays the single source of truth; the
    resolver just proposes ``authority_refs`` to write onto a node/qualia.

Public API:
  * :data:`FACET_ORDER` — the ordered consumption list per facet.
  * :func:`resolve` — ``(term, facet) -> [candidate dict]`` (rich, for the API).
  * :func:`as_authority_ref` — a candidate → the compact node/qualia ref shape.
  * :func:`write_authority_refs` — resolve + set ``node.data['authority_refs']``.
