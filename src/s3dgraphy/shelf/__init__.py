"""s3dgraphy.shelf — the Shelf substrate (Shelf v2 core, Session A).

A **shelf-graph** is a first-class collection of **un-hatted resources**
(un-instantiated LinkNodes = R0 stable IDs not yet referenced by a Document/RM).
It is representable in two interchangeable ways, both reusing the existing
machinery — NO new node type, NO datamodel change:

  * as a **member of the multigraph** — a plain :class:`~s3dgraphy.graph.Graph`
    tagged as a shelf (``graph.data["em_collection"] == "ShelfGraph"``), the
    Heriverse **ShelfGraph** convention;
  * as a **standalone, reusable em.json file** — a shelf is a file in its own
    right, importable into any study (save/load via the existing em.json I/O).

Each shelf entry is a LinkNode (E73) carrying its resource identity (the stable
ID, R0) PLUS its **capability/origin** (repo, resource type, and any acquisition
scope) on ``node.data["origin"]`` — preserved end-to-end so a downstream UI can
badge the source tier. This substrate never strips it.

Pure library: no UI, no connectors, no OpenShelf/web. Instantiation is
reference-by-stable-ID (reuse-not-duplicate): the same resource is referenced
into a study graph by its ID, never cloned under a new ID.
