"""The em.json CONTAINER — a project is one file holding one or more graphs.

The decision (E.D., 2026-08-13): **an em.json/emj is always a container**::

    {
      "header": {...},
      "graphs": {
        "<graph id>": { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] },
        "shelf":      { ... em_collection: "ShelfGraph" },
        "dtc":        { ... em_collection: "DTCCorpus" }
      },
      "active_graph_id": "<graph id>"
    }

A study is one or more graphs plus its shelf and its **documentation** (the DTC
corpus, 2026-08-17: acquisitions, transformations and the resources they are
about — a forest that shares its leaves, and ontologically not a matrix); a
single graph is a **container-of-one**. This is the shape **Heriverse already reads**, so writing
it means Heriverse does not change — the format was not invented here, it was
adopted.

Why it matters beyond tidiness: the project becomes **one portable file**, and
"integrate later" becomes a local operation. You work offline on your own emj,
somebody else works on theirs, and afterwards one container takes in the other's
graphs — nodes shared between them merge **by UUID**, which s3Dgraphy has always
been able to do (`add_node(overwrite=True)`). No server, no session, no lock.

**P3 (2026-08-13) — the merge is now DATED and the conflicts are VISIBLE.**
Two divergent edits of the same node no longer resolve as "whoever arrived
last": the editorial stamps decide (`modified_at`, falling back to
`created_at`), the more recent version wins, and every contested node is
recorded in `MergeReport.conflicts` saying *who overwrote whom, and when*.
Deciding by date rather than by arrival makes the result **independent of the
order you merge in** — A into B and B into A land on the same project, which is
the least a collaboration tool owes you.

**P4.1 (2026-08-13) — the merge is a CRDT, and P3's missing piece arrived.**
The algebra moved to :mod:`s3dgraphy.crdt`: **OR-Set** for presence (with
tombstones) and **LWW-per-field** for content, clocks = the editorial stamps.
What that buys, concretely: two people who edited DIFFERENT fields of the same
node now keep **both** edits — the field-level fusion P3 had to declare as a
limit. Only a field they both wrote is a decision, and it is reported per field.

What this module deliberately does NOT do:

* **real-time transport.** The relay (em-server: fan-out + op-log + presence) is
  P4.2, and the client is P4.3. The algebra converges without a coordinator,
  which is exactly why it can be built and proved first, on a table.
* **tombstone GC.** Deletions stay as marks; compacting them belongs to the
  snapshot pass (P4.2), when it is knowable that every client is past the point.
* **manual conflict resolution UI**: this module produces the record; deciding
  what to do about it belongs upstream, where a person is.

Reading accepts BOTH shapes, always: the legacy single-graph document (which is
every file written before today) opens as a container-of-one, and nothing on
anybody's disk breaks.
