"""BK1 — the bake: an EM Narrative resolved into a static snapshot.

**Why a bake exists at all.** A live narrative is a set of embeds that mean
"whatever this node says now": change the unit, the text follows. That is what
makes it an editing surface, and it is exactly what a *published* text cannot be.
Publishing means committing to one reading, at one moment, with the pictures
actually in it — so the embeds have to be resolved once, into values, before any
renderer is asked to lay them out.

**The bake is not a format.** It knows nothing about DocX, LaTeX, HTML or a
notebook: it produces a plain structure of chapters and resolved blocks, and each
renderer reads it. That split is the point — three renderers over one bake cannot
disagree about what the narrative *said*, whereas three traversals of the graph
can, and would, drift.

It lives next to :mod:`s3dgraphy.narrative` and not in ``exporter/`` for the same
reason: an exporter answers "in what syntax", the bake answers "what is there".

**What resolution means, per ``view_type``** — the vocabulary is the same one L1
maps to print, read here as "what can be put on a page that no longer talks to
the graph":

=================  ====================================================
``source``         a citation: author/title/year — plus the image bytes
``document``       when the document *is* a picture (a plan, a
                   photographed page); ``document`` is both cited and
                   shown, which is why it is in two rows of this table
``rm``             a representation model: the bytes, read from its locator
``us``/``paradata``the label and, crucially, the **certainty**, as text
``map``            coordinates + an OSM link (a rendered tile: follow-up)
``scene3d``        a labelled placeholder + link (a render: follow-up)
``matrix``         idem
=================  ====================================================

**There is no ``image`` view_type.** BK1's brief named one, but the EM vocabulary
(``NARRATIVE_VIEW_TYPES``) does not have it: a picture reaches a narrative as a
``document`` ("a document or image") or as an ``rm``. Inventing the type here
would have meant the bake accepting embeds the datamodel rejects at construction —
a vocabulary that exists only in this file. The datamodel is the single source of
truth (ADR-001), so the bake reads it and maps what is really there.

Note the deliberate two-level naming: ``view_type`` belongs to the EM language and
is never invented here; ``BakedBlock.kind`` is the bake's own small set of things a
page can hold (``prose``, ``citation``, ``image``, ``unit``, ``map``,
``placeholder``, ``unresolved``). A renderer switches on ``kind`` — so a new
``view_type`` lands without touching any renderer.

**Nothing is invented, and nothing raises.** An embed that will not resolve
becomes a placeholder that SAYS it did not resolve. Both alternatives are worse:
raising throws away a whole publication over one missing file, and dropping the
block silently removes evidence from a text where its absence can no longer be
noticed. A snapshot is allowed to record a hole; it is not allowed to hide one.
