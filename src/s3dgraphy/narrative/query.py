"""DP-79 · P4 — the questions a narrative layer makes answerable.

Authoring a study *on the graph* rather than beside it buys exactly one thing,
and this module is where that thing becomes usable: the interpretation and the
evidence are the same data, so questions that cross them have answers.

Four of them, named by the design:

1. **which narratives cite this unit** — and in what order they say it;
2. **which narratives lean on a source that has since been retracted** — the
   question a reviewer asks, and the one nobody can answer with a PDF;
3. **interpretive coverage** — which epochs and activities have been written
   about at all, and which have not;
4. **reconstructions with a 3D scene and no text** — a model somebody built and
   nobody explained.

**No second truth.** Every function here reads the em.json graph in memory — the
same content the RDF projection restates as `P67_refers_to`. There is no index,
no cache and no precomputed table: an answer is derived when it is asked for, so
it cannot be stale, and adding a narrative does not require rebuilding anything.

The RDF projection deliberately does NOT reify chapters and blocks (a document
tree in a knowledge graph serves no query anybody runs). That is why the
*ordering* questions live here, on the property graph, where the blocks are:
SPARQL can answer "which narratives cite US 12"; only this can answer "and where
in the text".

Pure functions over a `Graph`: no I/O, no formatting, no opinion about who is
asking. Every one returns plain dicts, so a caller can put them in a table, a
notebook cell or a JSON response without unwrapping anything.
