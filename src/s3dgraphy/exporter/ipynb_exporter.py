"""A narrative as a **Jupyter notebook** — the fourth output, and the live one.

Three of the four renderings are snapshots: DocX, LaTeX and HTML resolve the
embeds once and freeze them, which is what a printed text has to be. This one is
different in kind, and the difference is the reason it exists:

    a notebook does not contain the answers. It contains the QUESTIONS,
    and the reader runs them.

So the prose becomes markdown cells and every embed becomes a **code cell that
queries the graph** — `narratives_citing`, `interpretive_coverage`,
`units_per_epoch` — against the study the reader loads at the top. Re-run it in a
year and it says what the study says then. That is not a nicety: a scholar who
wants to check an interpretation should be able to check it, and a static figure
is a claim you can only believe or doubt.

**It reuses, it does not reinvent.** The queries are `s3dgraphy.api`
(`narrative_*`, P4) and the metrics are **EMLab**'s (`emlab.metrics`, DP-21) when
the reader has EMLab installed — the notebook says so and falls back to the
library's own numbers when they do not. Nothing about a matrix or an epoch is
computed here.

**What stays a link.** The 3D embed. A scene is navigated, not plotted, and a
notebook that rendered a still of it would be claiming to show something it
cannot. It gets a link and the sentence saying what it is.

**No kernel here.** This writes a `.ipynb`; the reader opens it in their own
Jupyter or in EMLab. Executing it for them would mean running their code on our
machine, which is a different product.

Output is a plain dict in nbformat 4 — no `nbformat` dependency to write one, and
`json.dump` is the whole serialiser. A library other people install does not get
to require a notebook stack in order to export a notebook.
