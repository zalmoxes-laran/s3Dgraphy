"""L1 — a narrative projected to LaTeX, with its sources as a `.bib`.

**This is an exporter, not a renderer.** It emits two strings — a `.tex` body and
a `.bib` bibliography — and asks no LaTeX engine to exist. Nothing here typesets,
chooses a document class, or picks a font: those belong to whoever compiles.

The projection follows the same discipline as the RDF one: **project the value,
not the authoring**. A `Block` is not reified into anything — no environment named
after it, no marker recording that the text arrived in three pieces. Prose becomes
prose. An embed becomes what a printed page would put there: a figure with a
caption for something you look at, a citation for something you read. That
distinction is the whole mapping, and it is drawn from the embed's `view_type`.

Two rules kept the design honest:

* **Nothing is invented.** A source with no metadata becomes a minimal `@misc`
  with the title it has and nothing more — no guessed year, no fabricated author.
  A bibliography that invents a date is worse than one that admits it lacks one.
* **Keys come from ids.** A bib key is derived from the node id, deterministically,
  so `\\cite{}` in the `.tex` and the entry in the `.bib` cannot drift, and a
  re-export produces the same keys for the same graph.

    It used to be a body only, to be `\\input{}` into the author's own preamble,

    else's book. The principle is right and the default was wrong: measured on
    20 Aug 2026, the exported file opened in a LaTeX editor as three errors —
    "Undefined control sequence \\section", "Missing \\begin{document}",
    "\\guillemetleft unavailable in encoding" — while the HTML export of the same

    and "it is a fragment" is a fact the file states in a comment that a compiler
    does not read.
    
    So the fragment is still available, as `fragment=True`: the same body, with a
    header saying which packages it needs. A caller who has a preamble asks for
    it; everybody else gets a file that works.

    `bib` holds one entry per cited source, keyed by :func:`bib_key`. It is
    unchanged by this flag — a bibliography is not part of a preamble.

    `figures` names which embeds have a rendered image beside the document (keys

    the keys are read, the values may be the bytes or anything truthy). Those
    become real `\\includegraphics{fig/…}`; the rest keep the commented
    placeholder. The caller is the one writing `fig/`, which is why it is the one
    that says what is in there — this function never touches a filesystem.
