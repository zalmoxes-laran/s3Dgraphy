"""Where a tombstone must SURVIVE, and where it must be ABSENT.

A deletion in this library is not a missing key, it is a mark: ``data.removed =
{ts, by}`` kept inline, id and all (:mod:`s3dgraphy.crdt`). That is the only way
delete-vs-edit can be decided instead of guessed — "absent" and "not yet known"
look identical, and a merge that cannot tell them apart resurrects the dead.

The mark is therefore load-bearing in one direction and **poison in the other**.
Keep it where somebody still has to MERGE; let it out where somebody merely
READS, and a US the excavator deleted comes back to life in a Heriverse scene or
in a GraphML somebody opens in yEd next year. Since DP-76 that second direction
is a data path and not a hypothesis: a model is promoted out of the .blend and
published, so "the projection is downstream of the truth" now has consumers.

So the policy is per-surface, and it is written here once:

**KEEP** — the reader will merge, and needs to know a thing died:
    ``em.json``            the authoring truth (a project file is a peer)
    ``rdf:round_trip``     the isomorphic projection (``EM.removedAt``)
    ``relay snapshot``     a client joining a room converges only if it sees them

**HIDE** — the reader consumes, and a dead node is not data:
    ``graphml``            yEd / interchange
    ``heriverse``          the web scene
    ``rdf:publish``        the published triples

And the word HIDE is precise: in a dissemination surface a tombstone is not
greyed out, not marked, not exported-with-a-flag. It is **absent** — no node, no
``removedAt``, and no edge left dangling onto the hole it left.

The predicate is not re-implemented here. :func:`s3dgraphy.crdt.is_removed`
already answers "is this deleted AS OF ITS OWN STATE" (an edit later than the
deletion is a resurrection, and that decision belongs in one place); this module
only adapts it to the in-memory ``Node`` / ``Edge`` objects the exporters hold,
and offers :func:`live_view` so a dissemination exporter can filter ONCE, at its
entrance, instead of at every one of its twenty read sites.
