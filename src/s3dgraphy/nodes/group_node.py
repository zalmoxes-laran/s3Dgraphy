    place is this in?*.

    Three required *kinds* coexist on the same axis and may compose on
    the same node:

    - ``toponym``    — external / administrative identity
                       (Pompei, Lazio, Italia)
    - ``study``      — operational / procedural identity
                       (saggio, settore, quadrato, sondage)
    - ``functional`` — interpretive / semantic identity
                       (basilica, room A, courtyard)

    Propagation is **additive**: multiple memberships compose, none
    overrides — distinct from ``EpochNode`` which is substitutive
    (finest-grained wins).

    Membership is **m:n** via multiple ``is_in_location`` edges. A wall
    between two rooms belongs to both. The optional ``is_primary: True``
    attribute on one of the edges marks the membership that should be
    rendered as a yEd group folder in em-graph (yEd cannot draw
    overlapping group folders).

    Locations are **hierarchical**: a ``LocationNodeGroup`` can itself
    be ``is_in_location`` of another ``LocationNodeGroup``
    (Pompei → Sector 4 → Casa del Fauno → Room 12).

    A Location is **identitary**, not geometric. For coordinates / EPSG
    / shifts use the dedicated ``GeoPositionNode``. The two concepts are
    linked at the CIDOC level via P161 has spatial projection
    (E53 Place → E94 Space Primitive).

    CIDOC-CRM mapping:
      - the ``LocationNodeGroup`` itself        →  E53 Place
      - the ``kind`` attribute classifies it    →  E55 Type
      - ``is_in_location`` (node → location)    →  P53 has former or current location
      - ``is_in_location`` (location → location, recursive)
                                                →  P89 falls within
      - non-CIDOC fields (``is_primary``,
        ``propagation``, ``kind`` enum value)   →  ``s3d:`` extension URIs

class FunctionalUnitNodeGroup(GroupNode):
    """Typed aggregation of the stratigraphic units that make up one
    recognisable functional / architectural component — the *column* made
    of its US, the *wall* made of its US (DP-72).

    Scope note
    ----------
    A Functional Unit answers *what a set of stratigraphic units is, as a
    building component*. It is built **bottom-up** from the stratigraphic
    reading: the units it aggregates stay intact and fully stratigraphic
    underneath, each keeping its own epochs, paradata and provenance. The
    Functional Unit adds a handle for the component as a whole — to name
    it, filter by it, and project it to architectural-component
    vocabularies.

    Membership is a **tag**, not a nesting: a member carries an
    ``is_in_functional_unit`` edge towards the Functional Unit. The relation
    is the same mereological P46i that ``is_part_of`` projects to — what
    differs is the ROLE in the EM language. ``is_part_of`` is the nesting
    axis (one primary drawing parent, a box around its members, propagates
    the epoch lane); a Functional Unit legitimately **spans epochs** — a
    wall built across four of them still carries the roof as one body — and
    a swimlane box cannot. So membership stays m:n and additive, does not
    claim the member's primary parent, and every view opts into drawing it:
    the functional reading lives beside pure stratigraphy without either
    constraining the other.

    What it is NOT
    --------------
    - Not an **ActivityNodeGroup** (DP-43), which clusters *actions /
      processes* ("construction of the portico"). A Functional Unit is
      what the units *are*, not what was done to them or when.
    - Not a generic **container** (DP-36). A US / USD / VSF acting as a
      container is still a stratigraphic unit, with its own formation
      event and its own place in the sequence; a Functional Unit is a
      typed aggregation with no formation event of its own.
    - Not a **LocationNodeGroup** of kind ``functional``, which is a named
      *place* ("Room 12") and answers *where*. A Functional Unit is a
      *component* and answers *what*.
    - Not a geometric construction grammar. The component's geometry type
      travels **by reference** to an external taxonomy
      (``geometry_type_ref`` — bSDD / Getty AAT / an HBIM shape-grammar
      vocabulary); nothing of that vocabulary is internalized or
      validated here.

    Attach rules
    ------------
    - members: ``StratigraphicNode ─is_in_functional_unit→ FunctionalUnit``
    - nesting: a Functional Unit may itself be
      ``is_in_functional_unit`` another one (the capital inside the column).
    - ``FunctionalUnit ─is_part_of→ US`` stays legal and means something
      else: the whole component **physically embedded** in a stratigraphic
      unit (a column engaged in a later wall). That one IS containment.
    - the orthogonal axes stay orthogonal: a member keeps its own
      ``has_first_epoch`` (time), ``is_in_activity`` (intention) and
      ``is_in_location`` (place); the Functional Unit does not override
      them and has no epoch of its own — its temporal extent is DERIVED
      from its members, and may cover several epochs.

    EM manual: *Stratigraphic Nodes* → "SU / USD / VSF as Container" and
    *Connectors* → ``is_part_of`` ("Containment is a relationship (edge),
    not a change in node type").

class RepresentationModelNodeGroup(GroupNode):

    D.09 (EM16-RMNG, riunione E.D. / S. Berto del 10-09-2026).

    Why it exists
    -------------
    An RM container has lived only on the Blender side, as the
    ``scene.rm_containers`` PropertyGroup: the grouping that gives the set its
    meaning was invisible to anyone reading the graph. This class is the
    graph-side citizen of that same idea, so the set can be named, carried and
    read outside Blender.

    THE RULE THAT GOVERNS IT: IT SITS BESIDE, IT DOES NOT REPLACE
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    The group does **not** take the place of the bond between a single
    representation model and its epoch. Every member keeps its own
    ``has_first_epoch`` / ``survive_in_epoch`` / ``has_representation_model``
    edges exactly as before, and the Document keeps its DIRECT edges to each
    model. The group is added on top; it is never put in between.

    That is what makes it additive in the strict sense: a consumer that knows
    nothing about this class reads precisely what it read before and simply
    ignores one extra node. The form «epoch → RM group → many RM» will be
    possible when Heriverse and EM Studio can handle it, and is deliberately
    NOT prepared for here.

    Shape
    -----
    ::

        Epoch     ──(existing edges, untouched)──▶  RM, RM, RM
        Document  ──has_representation_model──▶     RM, RM, RM      (direct, kept)
        Document  ──has_representation_model──▶     RMNodeGroup     (new)
                          └── is_in_representation_model_group ◀──  RM, RM, RM

    Membership is a **tag**, on the same axis as ``is_in_functional_unit``
    (DP-72) and ``is_in_location``: the member carries the edge towards the
    group, the group claims nothing of the member. Unlike those two, membership
    here is **1:1** — a mesh belongs to exactly one container, which is the rule
    already in force on the Blender side (``rm_manager/containers.py``) and is
    what makes ``mesh_names`` authoritative there.

    Legal states, both of which the UI already shows
    -----------------------------------------------
    - **empty** — a group with no members, the "grey" state of a container just
      created;
    - **unattached** — a group no Document points at.

    Both must be representable in the graph, so neither is validated away.

    What it is NOT
    --------------
    - Not a **FunctionalUnitNodeGroup** (DP-72), which aggregates STRATIGRAPHIC
      units into a building component. Its members are models, not units.
    - Not an **ActivityNodeGroup**: nothing happened here, and the set has no
      formation event of its own.
    - Not a **LocationNodeGroup**: it answers neither *where* nor *what
      component*, but *which set of models a document publishes*.
    - Not the Document. The Document is the documentary anchor and stays where
      it is; deleting the container removes the group and NOT the Document
      (the behaviour ``unregister_container`` already has).
