"""GCPSetNode + RegistrationTransformNode — how a model got into the world.

A photogrammetric model comes out of the engine in *some* frame. Which frame,
and by what right, is not a property of the mesh: it is a **measurement** and a
**solution**, and both are facts somebody made and somebody else may have to
check. So they are nodes, not fields on the model.

Two classes, because they answer two different questions and fail in two
different ways:

* :class:`GCPSetNode` — the CONTROL: for each point, where it was seen (which
  photograph, which pixel) and where it is in the world (coordinates + CRS +
  uncertainty). This is the *evidence*. It can exist before any model does, and
  it survives being re-used by a second reconstruction.
* :class:`RegistrationTransformNode` — the SOLUTION: the 7-parameter similarity
  (rotation, translation, scale) that the bundle adjustment settled on, with its
  residuals. This is what the model is placed by, and it is the thing that gets
  REPLACED when better coordinates arrive — the old one staying in the graph,
  historicised, because "we moved it in March" is provenance.

**The two modes the design turns on** (EM_design_photogrammetry-pipeline §5) are
visible in the graph's SHAPE, not in a flag somebody has to read:

* **absolute** — a GCP set with known world coordinates → a transform that
  ``has_gcp_set`` points at. Registered, and you can see what registered it.
* **local** — a LiDAR/scale-bar prior only → a transform with ``scale`` solved
  and no GCP set, and ``crs`` left None. Scaled and oriented in a site-local
  frame, *honestly not georeferenced*. Re-registering later is a NEW process
  producing a NEW transform, never an edit of this one.

A model with no transform at all is a model nobody placed. That is also a true
sentence, and the absence says it.
