    RESIDENCIES = ("reference", "resident")

    #: WHAT THIS RESOURCE IS FOR, in the argument. Two values, and **orthogonal
    #: to everything else about it** (E.D. 2026-08-24):
    #:
    #: * `comparandum` — brought in to be compared against. A photograph of
    #:   another site, yes; but equally a model of *my own* study that I am
    #:   holding up next to this one;
    #: * `internal_source` — evidence inside this study's own reasoning. A URI
    #:   on somebody else's server can be exactly that.
    #:
    #: So the role is **not derivable** from `scope` (the three fences) nor from
    #: `residency` (where the bytes are): an own-study asset can be a
    #: comparandum, an external URI can be an internal source. That is why it is
    #: written and never computed — and why there is no `effective_role`: a role
    #: nobody stated is UNSET, not a default. Guessing one would put a claim
    #: about somebody's argument into their file.
    ROLES = ("comparandum", "internal_source")

    #: WHICH SIDE OF A DERIVATION this resource is on (E.D. 2026-09-13, §15).
    #:
    #: * `master` — kept because it is the source the others are made FROM.
    #:   Losing it is losing something: nothing can remake it.
    #: * `distribution` — made so that somebody else can consume it. Losing it
    #:   costs a button: it is remade from its master.
    #:
    #: **It is not a three-rung ladder.** It is a role in a PAIR, and a chain
    #: can hold several masters: the photogrammetric original on an external
    #: disk *and* the working mesh inside the .blend are both masters, tied to
    #: each other by a derivation. Asking "which rung is this on" has no answer;
    #: asking "is this the source or the thing made from it" always does.
    #:
    #: **«Published» is not a tier**: it is the STATE of a distribution whose
    #: locator resolves to something reachable and which carries a checksum. A
    #: third value would have made publication a property of the bytes instead
    #: of a property of where they got to.
    #:
    #: Why the axis has to exist at all: the contract must **declare** what a
    #: resource is instead of letting every consumer deduce it. Heriverse was
    #: guessing with "it has a checksum, so it is the published one" — a rule
    #: that is right by accident and wrong the first time somebody records a
    #: digest for a working file.
    #:
    #: Orthogonal to `scope`, `residency` and `role`, and `role` is NOT the
    #: place for it: that axis is already `comparandum` / `internal_source` by
    #: E.D.'s decision of 24-08-2026, and its own docstring says a third value
    #: invented at a call site would be "a word".
    TIERS = ("master", "distribution")

    #: HOW THE BYTES ARE SHAPED, because a consumer has to know before it can
    #: decide whether it can open them.
    #:
    #: * `file` — one file;
    #: * `directory` — a tree, served as it lies;
    #: * `archive` — a tree in a container (a zip).
    #:
    #: The zip is a first-class citizen and not a packaging accident: **a
    #: tileset travels as a zip**, because a directory of some thousands of
    #: tiles destroys disks and bandwidth alike. A consumer must read that from
    #: the data, not guess it from an extension — guessing from `.zip` works
    #: until the day somebody serves an archive without one, and fails silently.

            url_type (str, opzionale): Tipo di URL. Defaults to "External link".
            description (str, opzionale): Descrizione del collegamento.
                Default **vuoto**, e nessun auto-riempimento (NIGHT-RIM3/B3.3,
                decisione 11 di E.D.). Prima il default era la sentinella
                `"No description"` e il costruttore scriveva
                `description or f"Link to {name}"`: due modi diversi di
                inventare un dato che nessuno aveva scritto.

                Perché conta più di quanto sembri: quella sentinella finiva
                su disco come se fosse un valore, e al SECONDO giro di
                round-trip em.json non sopravviveva — diventava
                «Link to <nome>». Cambiando la descrizione cambia l'impronta
                sha256 del documento, e da quel checksum dipende il calcolo
                della staleness (B4). Un campo che si riscrive da solo
                rendeva "stantio" un documento che nessuno aveva toccato.

                Vale per i nodi NUOVI: i dati esistenti non si migrano.
            checksum (str, opzionale): content digest, ``"sha256:<hex>"``. The
                ALGORITHM travels with the value on purpose — a bare hex string
                is unreadable in two years, and a checksum nobody can verify is
                worse than none. Absent for a pure URI/LOD resource: there are no
                bytes here to hash, and its identity is already the URI.
            scope (str, opzionale): one of :attr:`SCOPES`.
            residency (str, opzionale): one of :attr:`RESIDENCIES`.
            role (str, opzionale): one of :attr:`ROLES` — what the resource is
                FOR in the argument, orthogonal to scope and residency.
            tier (str, opzionale): one of :attr:`TIERS` — the source side or
                the made-from side of a derivation.
            packaging (str, opzionale): one of :attr:`PACKAGINGS` — file,
                directory or archive.
            size_bytes (int, opzionale): the weight. A measured fact, and one of
                the two things that let a consumer pick between LOD siblings.
            primitives (dict, opzionale): counts of whatever this is made of —
                ``{"vertices": n, "faces": n}`` for a mesh, ``{"points": n}``
                for a cloud, ``{"tiles": n}`` for a tileset. Recorded only when
                it is known at zero cost; an open dict rather than two fixed
                fields **on purpose**, because a point cloud has no faces and a
                fixed pair would be the same ageing enumeration in disguise.
            preferred (bool, opzionale): a SUGGESTION between candidates that
                are equally valid — never a gate. See :meth:`set_preferred`.

        Why measures and not a level enumeration: `lod0`/`lod1`/`lod2` is a
        vocabulary that ages the moment somebody adds a level in the middle, and
        it means different things in different pipelines. A weight and a
        primitive count are measured facts, they never age, and they are what a
        consumer with a bandwidth budget actually needs to compare.

        The three new fields are **additive and optional**, and they are written
        ONLY when given. Absent means UNKNOWN, not false: every resource written
        before these existed must keep saying nothing rather than start claiming
        it is un-hashed, own-study and by-reference — three assertions nobody
        made. (Reading is a different matter: see :meth:`effective_scope`.)
