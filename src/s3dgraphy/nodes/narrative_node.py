"""EM Narrative — the narrative node and the structures it carries (N0).

A narrative tells the story of a site as **chapters**: the lanes of the graph
(epochs, activities) become the sections of a text, and beside each thing that
happened in antiquity stands *how we know it* — the sources, the paradata chain.

Two decisions shape this module, both worth stating because they are the ones
that could reasonably have gone the other way.

**Chapters and blocks are DATA, not nodes.** Every other composite in EM —
a paradata group, an activity — models membership with edges, and that is right
for membership. But a narrative is *ordered*, and EM has no ordered-edge
primitive: expressing "chapter 3 comes after chapter 2" would mean minting an
integer attribute per node and sorting on it, which is a list wearing a costume.
A chapter also has no existence apart from its narrative — nobody will ever ask
"which graphs contain this chapter". So chapters and blocks are plain
dataclasses serialised into ``node.data``, where a list is a list, and the
NarrativeNode itself is the first-class, queryable, versionable thing the spec
asks for.

**An embed is a reference, never a copy.** ``Block.ref`` holds the stable id of
an EM resource and nothing else: no title, no thumbnail, no cached value. The
moment a US is renamed or a source is withdrawn, every narrative that cites it
says the new thing. That is the whole reason for authoring on the property graph
instead of pasting text — and it is why :meth:`NarrativeNode.referenced_ids`
exists rather than a `referenced_names`.

Two-tier invariant: this is the **authoring** layer (property graph, em.json).
RDF is a projection of it, emitted by the exporter — never the other way round.
