"""The DTC **corpus**: the documentation, as a graph of its own.

A study's em.json has always held one kind of graph — the Extended Matrix: units,
epochs, the paradata hanging off them. The digital provenance was written *into*
that graph, which is why a DTC chain drawn in EMStudio came out inside a
stratigraphic matrix, where it does not belong: an acquisition is not a unit, a
transformation is not a phase, and a swimlane has nothing to say about either.

So the corpus is a **member of the container in its own right**, exactly as the
shelf is (`em_collection: "ShelfGraph"` → here `"DTCCorpus"`). Same mechanism,
because the mechanism is good: a marker on the graph, not a special key in the
file, so a reader that knows nothing about corpora still opens the document and
Heriverse keeps reading what it always read.

What makes it a different KIND of graph, and not just another study graph:

* it holds **acquisitions, transformations and resources** — the digital
  provenance. No stratigraphic units, no epochs;
* it is a **forest, not a tree**, and the forest **shares its leaves**: an
  orthophoto derived from two flights is one output with two `dtc_had_input`
  edges, and both flights keep their own root. That is native here and was
  awkward inside a matrix, where everything wants a single parent to be drawn
  under;
* the **resources are the shared hinge** with the study: a study graph points at
  an asset by id (`has_linked_resource`), the corpus says how that asset came to
  be. The same node id in both members is the point, not a duplication —
  reference-by-id is the convention the shelf already uses.

Scope and versioning of a corpus (one per study? one per site, referenced by
several studies? addressed by URI/PID?) are **open decisions** and deliberately
not wired here: `corpus_of` finds or makes the member of THIS container, and
nothing in this module assumes there is only ever one in the world.
