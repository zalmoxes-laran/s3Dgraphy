"""s3dgraphy.dtc — DTC (Digital Twin Chain) residency ops (ECHOES, R3).

Provenance is a property of the DATA: a DTC can live WITH the asset store
(referenced by the knowledge graph) rather than baked into em.json, and be baked
back on demand. This package provides the pure detach / inject / bake ops that
realise that "residency" axis, reusing the existing ``injected_by`` + bake
convention (:mod:`s3dgraphy.transforms.aux_tracking`) — no parallel mechanism.

The DTC references its resources by **stable ID** (the Resource layer,
:func:`s3dgraphy.resources.stable_resource_id` = the ResourceNode UUID), so a DTC is
reusable across graphs: the same resources → the same provenance.
