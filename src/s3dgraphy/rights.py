"""What may be done with ONE asset — read off the graph, never duplicated.

An asset is bytes in a store, addressed by its sha256. What those bytes are
*allowed to be* — who made them, under which licence, whether they are still
embargoed — is not a property of the store: it is said in the graph, on the
`ResourceNode` that points at them and on the DTC chain that produced them.

This module is the one place that knows how to walk from a **digest** to that
answer. The rule it exists to keep true:

    the asset store CONSULTS the graph; it does not keep a second copy of it.

A server that cached "this digest is embargoed until March" would be holding a
claim it cannot keep honest — the embargo lives in a document people edit, and
the copy would be wrong the first time somebody changed their mind.

**Two ways the rights attach, and both are read.** The simplest is directly on
the resource (`ResourceNode -has_license-> LicenseNode`), which is what an
authoring UI writes when somebody says "this photo is CC-BY". The other is
through the **DTC**: a process node that produced or consumed the resource
(`has_linked_resource`, `dtc_had_output`, `dtc_had_input`) carries the rights for
everything in that chain — which is how a whole acquisition campaign gets one
licence without stamping it on four hundred files. Direct wins when both are
present: the more specific statement is the one somebody made about *this*
object.

**Writing is the other half** (`enrich_asset_dtc`). Attribution is an ACT, not a
field: somebody *declares* that a file is CC-BY, or that it was made by a
colleague who is not in the room, or that it stays embargoed until March — and
that somebody is not necessarily the author. So the act is signed: the AUTHOR is
who made the data, the ATTRIBUTOR is who says so, and both travel with a
timestamp. See `docs/asset-dtc-protocol.md` for the tool-agnostic protocol.

**Nothing is invented.** A resource with no licence reads as no licence
(`license: None`); the *default* is a separate question and it is answered where
a default belongs — `study.DEFAULT_LICENSE`, exposed beside the fact, never in
place of it. And an asset the graph has never heard of returns `None`: "I know
nothing about this digest" is not the same sentence as "this digest is free".

# The reading half above answers "what may be done with these bytes". This half
# is how that answer gets there, and the design decision it encodes is E.D.'s:
#
#     attribution is an ACT, not a field.
#
# Licence, author and embargo are filled in UPSTREAM (when the file is made) or
# DOWNSTREAM — later, sometimes posthumously, and often **by somebody who is not
# the creator**. A cataloguer states the licence of a photograph taken in 1978 by
# a colleague who has since retired; that statement is true, useful, and it is
# not authorship. A model with one "author" field cannot say it without lying.
#
# The DTC holds it because the DTC reifies acts. So:
#
#   * `has_author` → the AUTHOR: who made the data. An ORCID that may belong to
#     somebody absent, or dead;
#   * `attributed_by` + `attributed_at` on the statement → the ATTRIBUTOR: who
#     said it, and when. The signature of the act.
#
# Distinct from the editorial stamps (`created_by`/`modified_by`), which record
# the hand that touched the FILE. The attributor is a claim about the world; the
# editorial stamp is a fact about the document. Conflating them would make
# "somebody edited this" and "somebody vouches for this" the same sentence.
