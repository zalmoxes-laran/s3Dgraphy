"""Correct resolution of ``allowed_connections`` — REPORT-ONLY (S1).

``Graph.validate_connection`` is permissive by construction: the connections
datamodel lists **class** names (``SpecialFindUnit``, ``ExtractorNode``) while
``Node.node_type_map`` is keyed by **node_type** (``SF``, ``extractor``), so the
lookup misses, falls back to ``object`` and lets (almost) any endpoint through.
It only bites where a class name happens to also be a node_type — ``EpochNode``
— or, worse, where it is the node_type of a *different* class:
``"StratigraphicNode"`` is the node_type of ``VirtualStratigraphicUnit``, so
that name resolves to one subclass instead of the family.

This module implements the resolution correctly, as **pure functions**. It
changes nothing: ``Graph.add_edge`` and ``Graph.validate_connection`` keep their
current behaviour, and no graph is ever mutated here. Its purpose is to measure
the blast radius before anyone decides to make the core strict (decision D2:
keep degrading to ``generic_connection``, but make it visible).

The same logic is used by :mod:`s3dgraphy.shelf.core` to decide facet attachment
(Shelf v2 / C3), which is where it was first written.

# load recomputes them from what the graph actually says.
#
# Until now they only existed on the GraphML path, produced as side effects
# while the drawing was being read. An em.json loaded straight from disk had
# none of them — the same graph, silent. That also meant the two paths said
# different things about the same file.
#
# The three families below are the state ones: a node with no type, a group with
# no role, an edge that came out generic. They are exactly what the S6 panels
# aggregate, and exactly what `connection_report` measures — so the measuring is
# reused here rather than written twice.

#: Set on the graph to remember which warnings this function contributed, so a
#: second call replaces them instead of appending a duplicate set.
