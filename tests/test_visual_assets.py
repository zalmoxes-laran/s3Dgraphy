"""Every 2D icon the datamodel DECLARES exists — because 2D is what renders.

The asymmetry between the two assertions in this file is the whole point:

* **2D is enforced.** `em_visual_rules.node_styles` is read by EMStudio's
  `icons.ts`, which resolves vector-then-raster and returns *null* when neither
  file is there. A declaration naming a file that does not exist therefore fails
  SILENTLY: the canvas draws the node's shape and nobody sees an error. Measured
  on 2026-08-29: four such declarations had accumulated (SE, TSU, serUSD, and
  `unknown`, which named a `unknown.png` that never existed), plus GRAPH, which
  had *neither* half and drew no icon at all.
* **3D is reported, not enforced.** Sixteen of the forty-one styles declare a
  `.glb` that has not been modelled yet, and that is a known state of the visual
  language rather than a bug: the 3D set covers the stratigraphic core and stops
  there. Asserting it would mean a permanently red suite or sixteen fabricated
  assets, and a placeholder that looks official is harder to notice than an
  absence. So it is counted and named, and the number is allowed to go down.

# vocabulary declares its icon differently — a bare `glyph` NAME, resolved by

# check in this file and the one EMStudio's `sync-datamodels.sh` prints walked

# apparatus axis declared seven glyphs (`11_device_optical` … `_gnss`) and the
# directory stopped at `10_laserscanner.svg`. Seven declared, zero drawn, every
# suite green and the vendoring script reporting «all declared files present» —
# true of what it looks at, and that is the whole lesson: a report is only as
# honest as its scope, and a family nobody walks is a family nobody defends.

# datamodel's own note: these names are «recorded here as data only», wired to a
# renderer in a later slice. That is exactly the window in which an absence costs
# nothing to fix and is invisible — and the moment something reads them, the same
# absence becomes a hole in the canvas that `icons.ts` draws as silence.
