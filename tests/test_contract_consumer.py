"""The CONSUMER path — the contract's outgoing face, and Heriverse as its
reference.

Blender (reference #1) proved a connector that writes: app-side, bidirectional,
guarded. Heriverse proves the other half — **read-only**, **cloud**,
**dissemination** — and the reason it comes second is that it is the test of
whether "one contract, many tools" is a design or a slogan. Each test below is
one sentence of that (2026-08-22, with E.D.):

* a consumer is **served**, not called to write: `read-graph` hands over the
  graph, `subscribe` promises the changes, `resolve-asset` / `resolve-preview`
  resolve bytes by digest — and a writing capability is refused on the way out;
* what is published is **not what is stored**: no tombstones (a deleted US must
  be absent from a scene, not greyed out) and no un-baked proposals;
* it is **role-gated and rights-aware**: a public study serves an anonymous
  caller, a restricted one does not, and an embargoed asset is refused **with the
  date** to a consumer exactly as to a browser — with the licence exposed, so a
  viewer can say when it opens and under what terms;
* the **handshake is the same handshake** (`consumer_drift`'s comparison), so a
  stale viewer is refused with a sentence instead of showing half a study;
* and the **contract did not change to admit Heriverse**. A consumer is added
  with DATA — a descriptor and one capability name — which is the property that
  makes this a foundation rather than a hub with a shape. The last test in this
  file is the one that keeps that true.

What is NOT here, and is somebody else's half: the adapter inside Heriverse
(3DR's repository — this file holds the SPEC it implements against) and the
socket that carries a subscription (em-server's relay, which already speaks the
wire).
