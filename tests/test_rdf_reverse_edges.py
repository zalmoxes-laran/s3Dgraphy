"""Reverse edges in the RDF projection: the same fact, written either way.

The connections datamodel declares `reverse` on 49 of its 56 canonical edge
types, but keys `edge_types` by the canonical name alone. The exporter read
that dictionary raw, so a graph holding an `is_before` edge found no entry and
fell through to the generic fallback — and the fallback does not lose the
relation, it states a DIFFERENT one: `P130_shows_features_of`, a claim about
morphological similarity that nobody made.

RDF keeps no record of which way an author drew an arrow. `A is_after B` and
`B is_before A` are the same fact, so they must leave as the same triple.

#          with different epochs at their ends ALL have the recent unit as
#          source, none the reverse).
#   CIDOC: `A P120 occurs before B` puts the EARLIER entity in the subject —
