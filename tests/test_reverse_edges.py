"""The reverse of a relation is the SAME relation — measured on both holes.

The datamodel has declared the inverses since 1.5.3 (`overlies` ⇄
`is_overlain_by`) and `connections_loader` expands them correctly. Two places did
not read that expansion, independently:

* **the mapping validator** built its legal set out of the RAW json, so it
  refused `is_overlain_by` in a mapping while `Graph.add_edge` accepted the very
  same edge without a warning. A validator stricter than the graph sends an
  author to fix something that was never wrong;
* **the table importer** stored whatever direction the column happened to be
  written in. A US card records the same physical fact from both sides — "1
  copre 2" on one row, "2 coperto da 1" on the next — so one fact became two
  edges, and nothing downstream could tell they were one.

The second fix is opt-in (`source_settings.canonicalize_reverse`) because
EMStudio and Heriverse have not been re-vendored yet, so the default path must
still produce, edge for edge, what it produced yesterday. That is what
`test_the_flag_is_off_by_default` measures — the compatibility test, not a
formality.

The truth table is the DATAMODEL in every one of these tests. No literal list of
inverses is written here either: where a test needs to know that the reverse of
`overlies` is `is_overlain_by`, it asks `get_connections_datamodel()`.
