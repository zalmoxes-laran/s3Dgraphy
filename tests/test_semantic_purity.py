"""s3Dgraphy is the SEMANTIC library. This measures that it stayed one.

The pyproject calls it a "3D Stratigraphic Graph Management Library": Extended
Matrix, the property graph, the CIDOC mapping, the importers and exporters. A
concrete driver for a photogrammetric engine — REST endpoints, a task queue, an
archive — is none of those, and one lived here for a day (2026-08-29) before
moving to StratiGraph Server. The property is easy to lose again by accident, so
it is a test rather than a note in a report.

**What this does NOT forbid.** Optional backends that the library legitimately
speaks to are declared exceptions, by module: the MinIO resource backend and the
authority resolvers reach the network *by design*, behind a guard, and they are
the reason "no network anywhere" would be the wrong rule. The rule is narrower
and truer: the modules that carry MEANING must not.
