"""The mappings we ship must validate against the datamodel we ship with them.

A mapping file in this package is not documentation: a partner opens the one
nearest their data and edits it. On 2026-09-20 three of the eight did not
validate — twelve errors between them, all invisible until someone ran one.

The first test is the cheap structural one that would have caught every one of
them the day the datamodel moved. The rest measure what the generic mapping
actually carries into a graph, because validation only proves a mapping is
well-formed, not that the data arrives.

# A descriptor travels. The partner mappings live in the project's shared
# drive, and no test in this repository will ever see them — which is why the
# Basilica mappings sat invalid from February to September without anyone
# knowing. The answer is not to copy their files in here; it is that a
# descriptor carries the record of its own last check.
#
# Two versions, two different failures. The SCHEMA version is the grammar: the
# shape of the descriptor, which is what breaks reading it. The datamodel
# versions are the vocabulary: whether its node classes and edge names still
# mean what they meant. A mapping can be perfectly well-formed and name an edge
# that has since been deprecated, and that is not a parse error.
