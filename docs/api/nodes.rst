Node Types
==========

This section documents every node type in s3dgraphy. All nodes inherit
from :class:`s3dgraphy.nodes.base_node.Node` (documented in
:doc:`/api/core`) and register their ``node_type`` string in the global
``Node.node_type_map`` on import.

.. note::

   The ``node_type`` *string* — not the Python class name — is what is
   stored on the node, written to GraphML/JSON, and matched by
   :meth:`Graph.get_nodes_by_type` and the connection-validation rules.
   The class hierarchy (``real`` vs ``virtual`` families, ``is_series``
   membership) is driven by ``JSON_config/s3Dgraphy_node_datamodel.json``;
   use the helpers in :doc:`/api/classification` rather than hard-coding
   these strings.

Stratigraphic nodes
-------------------

The stratigraphic family carries the ``symbol`` / ``label`` /
``detailed_description`` class attributes used by the visual layer and
the JSON/GraphML exporters.

Paradata nodes
--------------

The paradata family encodes the *interpretation chain*: a
:class:`PropertyNode` (a claim) is justified by an
:class:`ExtractorNode` (extraction from one source) or a
:class:`CombinerNode` (a reasoning over several sources), which in turn
references :class:`DocumentNode` sources.

Grouping nodes
--------------

Group nodes organise other nodes along orthogonal planes: by activity,
by paradata container, by alternative time branch, or by spatial
location. In GraphML they are rendered as yEd group folders.

Representation & geometry nodes
-------------------------------

These nodes attach 3D geometry and spatial information to any node. A
:class:`GeoPositionNode` is *identitary* (where the object is on Earth)
and is distinct from the *geometric* representation models.

Geometry: the proxy is a property, the shape is its payload
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Datamodel versions: nodes 1.6.3 · connections 1.6.10 · qualia 1.6.1.**

A *proxy* is the geometry-without-material of a unit: the shape US101 has,
without asserting what it is made of. Until 1.6.3 it was a
``SemanticShapeNode`` hanging off the unit on its own — and a lone node cannot
say where it came from. "The proxy of US101" could not be traced to a
measurement, a photograph or a reprojection, because it had no paradata chain to
be traced through.

The proxy is now a ``PropertyNode`` whose ``property_type`` is ``geometry``, and
the SemanticShape is what that property points at::

    US ──has_property──▶ Property(geometry) ──has_semantic_shape──▶ SemanticShape
                              ▲                                    (hulls | spheres | .glb)
                              │ has_data_provenance
                        Extractor(s) ──combines──◀── Combiner

Two things follow, and both are the point: the proxy inherits the chain every
other quale has, so it can say *how* it is known; and ONE proxy can be
synthesised from SEVERAL sources — a photogrammetric mesh and a 1931 photograph —
instead of one node per source with nothing to join them.

``SemanticShapeNode`` itself did not change: same fields, same CIDOC mapping.
What changed is **who points at it**. Its ``type='proxy'`` option now names the
ROLE OF THE CARRIER ("this shape is the geometry of something"), not a standalone
proxy node.

.. warning::

   This is a **breaking change** for readers that expect a lone
   ``SemanticShapeNode`` attached to the unit (EM-blender-tools, Heriverse). See
   ``docs/deprecations.md`` for the migration.

Building one::

    from s3dgraphy import api

    api.create_geometry_proxy(
        graph, "US101",
        {"convexshapes": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]},   # or {"url": "US101.glb"}
        extractor_sources=["D1", region_id],               # a document, a 2D region
    )

With one source the call creates one extractor and no combiner — an inference
node between a single extractor and a property would assert a reasoning step
nobody performed. With several, a ``CombinerNode`` joins them and the property
hangs off it, because the property is the *conclusion* of the chain.

2D annotation
-------------

``AnnotationRegionNode`` is a region of ONE image — or of one page of a
multi-page resource — in NORMALISED [0,1] coordinates. It is an
``E36_Visual_Item`` (a region of a visual item is a visual item), attached to its
image with ``is_on_resource`` (P106i) and cited by a property with
``has_visual_reference`` (P138i).

It is **interpretation, not raw evidence**: tracing "this and not that" is
already interpreting, so a region never appears bare — it is created inside a
chain, by ``api.create_annotation_paradata``.

Do NOT confuse it with ``SemanticShapeNode``: that one is 3D geometry of the
SCENE (``crmgeo:SP5``, expressing *where* a thing is), while a region makes no
claim about where anything is — it says *which part of which picture* was looked
at. They are separate classes because they answer different questions in
different coordinate systems; one field set with a kind flag would force every
reader to work out which meaning it was holding before it could use the numbers.

Coordinates are normalised because a pixel region is only readable next to the
resolution it was drawn at, and the same photograph is routinely re-exported at
another size; normalised coordinates are a statement about the picture rather
than about a file, and they express directly as a W3C Media Fragment (the
selector the RDF projection emits, ``em:hasSelector``).
