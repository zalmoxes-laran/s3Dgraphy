Development Roadmap
===================

This document outlines the development roadmap for s3dgraphy, the core Python library 
that implements the Extended Matrix formal language for archaeological documentation.

.. note::
   s3dgraphy is currently developed within EM-tools but is being extracted as a 
   standalone library.

Version 1.0 (Q2 2025) - Standalone Library Release
---------------------------------------------------

âœ… **Completed Features**

- [x] Three core JSON files (Visual Rules, CIDOC Mapping, Connection Rules)
- [x] Stratigraphic node subclasses (US, USV, SF, etc.)
- [x] Actor and Link nodes implementation
- [x] Document and Extractor node support
- [x] Representation Model nodes
- [x] GraphML import compatibility
- [x] Tag parser for EM canvas integration
- [x] 3D model library (GLTF) and 2D icons (PNG)
- [x] Modular architecture revision
- [x] Information propagation algorithm (v1)
- [x] Color schema migration from EM-tools
